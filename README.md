Used grid css for rows and column spacing.
ionicons for beautiful icons which are used in the website
Used normalize.css which is a small CSS file that provides better cross-browser consistency in the default styling of HTML elements. It's a modern, HTML5-ready, alternative to the traditional CSS reset.
animate.css for some animation transitions
